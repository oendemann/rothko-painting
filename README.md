## About The Webpage

A guided project from the web design course on freeCodeCamp.

---

## Built With

* **HTML:** Used for the structure and format of the "painting" (separated the webpage into the different rectangles that made-up the painting).
* **CSS:** Used to create all details attributed to the painting (e.g. blur, color, margin, etc).

---

## What I Learned

1. I gained a better understanding of what the margin and padding syntax actually meant for a variable.
2. A reminder of common CSS shortands (e.g. margin and padding shorthands).
